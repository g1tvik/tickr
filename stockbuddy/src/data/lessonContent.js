          <p>A stock represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a "share."</p>
          
          <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Share:</strong> A single unit of ownership in a company</li>
            <li><strong>Shareholder:</strong> Someone who owns shares in a company</li>
            <li><strong>Dividend:</strong> A portion of company profits paid to shareholders</li>
            <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Total value of all company shares</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Why Do Companies Issue Stocks?</h3>
          <p>Companies sell stocks to raise money for growth, research, expansion, or other business needs. In return, investors get partial ownership and potential profits.</p>

            <li><strong>Place an Order:</strong> You tell your broker what stock you want to buy/sell and at what price</li>
            <li><strong>Order Matching:</strong> The exchange matches your order with someone who wants to do the opposite</li>
            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> The trade is completed and shares change hands</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> Money and shares are transferred (usually takes 2 business days)</li>

            <h4>Market Order vs Limit Order:</h4>
            
            <h5>Market Order</h5>
            <p>Buy or sell immediately at the current market price. You get the trade done quickly, but the price might not be exactly what you expected.</p>
            
            <h5>Limit Order</h5>
            <p>Set a specific price you're willing to pay or accept. The trade only happens if someone meets your price. You control the price, but the trade might not happen immediately.</p>
            
            <div style="margin-top: 15px; padding: 15px; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
              <strong>Example:</strong> If Apple is trading at $150, you could:
              <ul>
                <li>Market order: Buy immediately at around $150</li>
                <li>Limit order: Set a limit to buy at $148, and only buy if the price drops to that level</li>

        title: "Bid and Ask",
        content: `
          <h3>Understanding Bid/Ask Spread</h3>
          <p>Every stock has two prices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bid:</strong> The highest price someone is willing to pay for the stock</li>
            <li><strong>Ask:</strong> The lowest price someone is willing to sell the stock for</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The difference between bid and ask is called the "spread." A smaller spread usually means the stock is more liquid (easier to trade).</p>
          
          <h3>Market Hours</h3>
          <p>Regular market hours are 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. Pre-market and after-hours trading are also available but with less liquidity.</p>
